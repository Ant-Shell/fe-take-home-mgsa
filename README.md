## About The Project

[![Portfolio Preview][Preview-image]](https://github.com/Ant-Shell/fe-take-home-mgsa/assets/100455148/68ae92c6-27c2-4caf-88d4-721373fea811)

This web application was created for a week-long take home challenge. It allowed me to utilize skills learned in my bootcamp experience, and beyond, to craft a solution that is engaging and fun!

## Notes

There were lot of features and additional styling that I wanted to tackle during this project, but I had to scope down due to the completion timeframe of a week. There is room for refactoring and improvement, but overall I'm happy with the result. Most importantly, I learned a lot along the way!

**Update:**<br/>
I have submitted the project and completed my final interview. I am thankful for the opportunity, and intend to keep updating this project for additional learning opportunities. 

### Functionality includes...
- Intuitive user flow
- Product search
- Adding to cart
- Removing from cart
- "Purchasing" an order
- Confirmation of purchase

### Wins:

* I was happy with being able to complete the MVP in a week (and complete a stretch feature)!

### Challenges:

* I attempted two other stretch features, but had to scope down due to time constraints. I look forward to attempting them at a later time.
